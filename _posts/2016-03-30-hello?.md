Hello?! What!? Is it me writing a blog? Why'd I do something like that??

Well, the main reason behind it is learning. Building a website from scratch is
somewhat of an enterprise, even more, if it is the first one I ever build.
Maintaining a blog is also a nice way to dust off my language skills, which comes
handy, because I find myself being more and more active in several online
communities in the past few months, and these activities obviously require it.

I do not aim to get significant amount of visitor traffic at the moment.
Accordingly, this will be more of a personal production and creative diary, made public.

So, what can _you_ expect here?

* Facts, stuff and thoughts about various subjects in the field of programming,
  game development, digital art, music, mathematics (_note that I don't mathematics_).
  General nerd interesting stuff.
* Facts, stuff, news and updates about my personal creative projects, games.
* Tutorials (most likely on the field of game development).
* Stuff I'm not even aware of at the moment.

_Exciting_, isn't it?
