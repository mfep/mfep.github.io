Welcome
-------

  to the official site of **MoonRogue**. It is a space-themed **free puzzle game** with some rougelike-ish
  elements, such as permadeath, items and procedural level generation.
  The game is **single player**, but it features an **online scoreboard** powered by
  [Dreamlo](http://dreamlo.com). This is a one-man hobby project under
  active development using the awesome, open source **[Duality Engine](http://duality.adamslair.net)**,
  the development forum can be found [here](http://forum.adamslair.net/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=678).
  Every piece of artwork is **original**.

Features
--------

  * Turn-based, tactical gameplay.
  * Procedural generation - each playthrough is different.
  * Every element of the levels is interactable.
  * In space, oxygen is scarce. You need to plan every move.
  * Two enemy species, each specimen's behavior is randomized.
  * Several passive and active items.
